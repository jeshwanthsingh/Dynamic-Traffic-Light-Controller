# Dynamic-Traffic-Light-Controller
Overview:
The Dynamic Traffic Light Controller is a cutting-edge system designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections. Utilizing the power of Python and the Apache 2 license, this solution employs live camera feeds to analyze traffic density in real-time. By integrating YOLO object detection technology, it accurately counts vehicles at traffic junctions, allowing for dynamic adjustment of traffic signal durations. This innovative approach aims to significantly reduce road congestion, expedite travel times, and lower fuel consumption.

Background:
In many urban areas, the increase in population and vehicles has led to severe traffic congestion, resulting in prolonged delays, excessive fuel consumption, and increased air pollution. Traditional traffic light systems, which operate on fixed timers, are unable to adapt to changing traffic conditions, often exacerbating congestion. The Dynamic Traffic Light Controller addresses this challenge by adapting its signal timings in response to the actual traffic density observed at intersections. This adaptive strategy is particularly crucial in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and New Delhi, which are among the top ten globally for traffic congestion according to the TomTom Traffic Index. The implementation of this system represents a significant step towards more efficient and environmentally friendly urban traffic management.
